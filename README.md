# Portfolio
Hello, welcome to my portfolio !

You will find here some relevant project concerning my data science skills, from the data scrapping to the machine learning.
Because some files are big, they may not preview in github.
If this is the case, you can refer to the following links:
* [A_new_way_to_visualize_star_types_induces_by_Machine_Learning](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/ThomLlobEce/Portfolio/blob/master/A_new_way_to_visualize_star_types_induced_by_Machine_Learning.ipynb)
* [Data_Scrapping_On_Official_Formula_1_Website](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/ThomLlobEce/Portfolio/blob/master/Data_Scrapping_On_Official_Formula_1_Website.ipynb)
* [Filtering_spam_messages_from_scratch](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/ThomLlobEce/Portfolio/blob/master/Filtering_spam_messages.ipynb)

I hope you'll enjoy and wish you interesting reading!
